# LSTMBiasClassifier
Final Project for Neural Networks course.

This code builds a LSTM based classifier with self attention to identify bias by category. This is done using the ToxiGen dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/toxigen/toxigen-data

This is compared to one-shot prompting Mistral-7b.
